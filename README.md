Basic DSA with Java

This program creates a 2D array of each US state and capital (ordered by state name), prompts a user to provide the capital for a random state and outputting whether or not the guess is correct. A bubble sort is then completed to reorder the array by capital name. Finally, the user is asked to name the remaining state capitals and the program ends by outputting the number of correct guesses.
